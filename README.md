# Tales of Gielinor

## About

This is a total conversion mod for Crusader Kings III, a historical grand strategy game made by Paradox Interactive.
The goal is to recreate the world of Gielinor from the Game RuneScape by Jagex, Ltd.

This mod depends heavily on [Scale Theory](https://runescape.wiki/w/Scale_theory) in order to fit together the worlds and lore of both Old School RuneScape *and* RuneScape 3.
Scale Theory is also needed in order to provide enough baronies and counties for Gielinor to be playable in a game of Crusader Kings.
This means that certain liberties have to be taken;  however, the goal is still canon compatibility with both versions of RuneScape, where possible.
As a part of this, the map used for the mod is somewhat of an artistic representation, ultimately based on a [concept map](https://imgur.com/Ih5DPnd) created by [u/baroquespoon](https://www.reddit.com/user/baroquespoon) on Reddit.

The project was started in February 2022 by @niefia, and quickly grew to include a number of contributors.
